# Drone-Swarm-Controlled-by-Operator

This repository contains the implementation of the algorithms developed for the paper "Drone Swarm Controlled by Operator." The project demonstrates controlling a swarm of drones through a leader-follower strategy based on the Consensus Theory, where one drone (the leader) is manually controlled by an operator, and the other drones (followers) adjust their behavior based on the leader's movements. The algorithms enable the swarm to exhibit three main behaviors: aggregation, shape formation, and agent queuing. 

## Repository Structure
* 2DEnv: Includes the Python scripts for simulating drone swarm behaviors in a simplified 2D environment.
* simulink: Contains the MATLAB Simulink models used for simulating drone swarm behaviors with physical considerations.
